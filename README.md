# Challenge: Rock Paper Scissors

This was incredibly early in our web-development.  I managed to create a multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors game that would also support multiple games at once.  However my focus was completely on the back-end and the styling is almost non-existant. Single-player is also available against a randomized computer.
